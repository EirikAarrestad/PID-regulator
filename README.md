# Control System Simulation

# Overview

This Python program simulates a simple control system using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The control system regulates the temperature of a room by adjusting a heater's power. The simulation provides insights into the behavior of the system over time.

# Requirements

Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib

# Program Structure

ControllSystem.py: The main Python script containing the control system simulation.

ControlSystem class: Defines the control system parameters and behavior.

fill_vector_with_values function: Helper function to create a vector with varying target temperatures.

main function: The entry point for the program, allowing users to interactively set parameters, run simulations, and visualize results.

# Customization

You can modify the initial parameters of the ControlSystem class in the script to customize the simulation.
Adjust the simulation duration, time step, and other parameters in the main function.

# Output

The program generates a plot showing the target temperature, measured temperature, and heater power over time.
